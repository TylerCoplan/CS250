**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**
Interpreting user needs can be done through focus groups, user surveys or business analysis of the program.  The missing
features or desired functionality are turned into user stories that give a brief description of what a user wants, 
why they want it, and what they hope to accomplish with it.  This lets developers get a sense of what they should develop.

**How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**
Developing programs is a team effort.  Nothing is done in isolation.  Code should be adaptable and maintainable by others.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**
We listen to each other and do what is required to develop the product.  This can take us out of our normal roles at times.
Constantly learning from our experiences and continually striving to improve will make us good team members and developers.
